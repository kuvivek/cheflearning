Create a Hosted Chef Server on this link
https://api.chef.io.

1) This will ask for the Sign in.
Once the Sign In process is over. It will ask to create an Organization. 
2) Created an organization by providing a Full Name as "Vivek Chef Environment" and Short Display Name. I created this with the display name as "kuvivek".
It will generate a link called https://api.chef.io/organizations/kuvivek
